# Conversation Generation Prompt

This project uses a carefully crafted prompt to generate message sequences that feel like fragments of larger narratives. The actual prompt is kept in environment variables for security, but the general approach is:

- Generate 1-7 messages per sequence
- Create an atmosphere of mystery and intrigue
- Messages feel like glimpses into larger stories
- Context remains purposefully elusive
- Natural language with poetic undertones
- Mix of metaphorical and mundane messages
- Free distribution between participants
- Sequential timestamps

The implementation details and exact prompt engineering are maintained separately from version control.
