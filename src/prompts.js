export const CONVERSATION_PROMPT = `Generate 1-7 messages that feel like fragments of a larger story. Create an atmosphere of mystery where meanings lie between the lines. Messages can be metaphorical, reference shared memories, or hint at unspoken truths. Like finding a page torn from the middle of a book - the context should remain elusive yet intriguing. Messages can be distributed freely between participants, allowing for natural rhythm and flow. Can occasionally include mundane messages that gain new meaning from their mysterious context (20% chance). Use natural language with subtle poetic undertones. Times must flow sequentially. Return JSON with 'mensagens' array where each object has: 'ordem' (sequential number starting at 1), 'sender' (1 or 2), 'time' (24h format like '14:23'), and 'mensagem' (the text).`;
